First, read all of the comments in ALL of the classes. As you read those comments, write down your tasks so 
you can keep track of them and not forget any.

Then make sure no values given to a constructor of the Child class can receive invalid values. 
(ex: can a name be null? can a name be an empty string?)

After you finish that work, write tests, AT LEAST ONE FOR EACH CONSTRUCTOR of the Child class. 
Tests should be done using Scanner and the keyboard.

RULE: unless I asked you to take care of something or change something, do not change it.

That is all (and enough... lol).
